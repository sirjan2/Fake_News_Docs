\vspace{-0.5cm}

In an age where misinformation proliferates rapidly across digital platforms, discerning the credibility of news is crucial. This project, "TrueLens: A Fake News Detection System," addresses this challenge by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques integrated with user-friendly web technologies. The backend is developed using Python and Django with the Django Rest Framework (DRF), facilitating robust API management and data handling, while the machine learning model, powered by TensorFlow, employs sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) to analyze and classify news articles. The frontend, also developed with Django, provides an intuitive interface for users to input or paste news content for verification, and the system's data is efficiently managed with PostgreSQL. The project uses Git and GitHub for version control, ensuring seamless collaboration and continuous integration. TrueLens not only detects fake news but also serves as an educational tool, enhancing users' understanding of misinformation patterns and fostering critical evaluation skills. By making powerful AI accessible through a web interface, TrueLens contributes significantly to the fight against misinformation, offering a practical solution for individuals and organizations committed to maintaining the integrity of information in the digital age.
